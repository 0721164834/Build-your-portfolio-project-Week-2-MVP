# Recipe Web Project

## Introduction
This project aims to create an interactive web application for sharing and discovering recipes. Users can search for recipes, submit their own, save favorites, and leave comments and ratings.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **APIs**: Third-party recipe API for additional recipes

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and profile management
- **Recipe Search**: Search functionality with filters for cuisine and ingredients
- **Recipe Submission**: Users can submit their own recipes
- **Favorites**: Users can save their favorite recipes
- **Comments and Ratings**: Users can comment on and rate recipes

## Progress
### Rating: 8/10
This week, I completed the MVP, including user authentication, recipe search, and submission. The third-party recipe API integration is also done. However, the favorites feature and comments/ratings are still in progress.

## Challenges
### Technical Challenge
Integrating the third-party recipe API was challenging due to OAuth 2.0 authentication and rate limits. I implemented a Redis cache to handle rate limits and refactored the backend to accommodate the API's data structure.

### Non-Technical Challenge
Time management was difficult due to academic responsibilities. I created a detailed schedule to balance my studies and project work, but unforeseen commitments made it hard to stick to the plan. Maintaining motivation was also challenging, but support from peers and mentors helped.
